# Recap
Q: When count changes, what gets re-rendered?

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Counter />
      <footer>&copy; 2025</footer>
    </>
  );
}

const H1: React.FC<H1Props> = ({ count }) => {
  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
};

const H2 = () => {
  return <h2>üëã</h2>;
};
```

::right::

```jsx
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <div className="card">
        <H1 count={count} />
        <H2 />
        <Button
          label="count is"
          badge={count}
          clickHandler={() => setCount(count + 1)}
          severity="secondary"
        />
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```

# Best Practice: How to organize your code 

1. Constants / Static Values / Default Props / Config
    - Any plain constants, static data, or config variables used inside the component.
    - These should be outside the component if they don‚Äôt depend on props/state.
2. React State Hooks (useState)
    - Declare all state variables near the top.
3. Memoization Hooks (useMemo, useCallback)
    - This ensures you use fresh state values as dependencies.
4. Side Effects (useEffect, useLayoutEffect)
    - This order makes it easier to see effects triggered by state changes.
5. Event Handlers and other functions
    - Can come here if they are not memoized, or sometimes before memoized ones if simpler.
    - Often handlers are memoized with useCallback and placed earlier.
6. Rendering Logic / JSX

# Optimization: React.memo

- Q: Why did H2 re-render if it didn't depend on `count`?
  - A: because React tries to re-render all descendants, regardless.  This is because it's hard to know with 100% certainty, whether H2 depends indirectly on `count`.  
  - React would rather err on the side of caution and re-render all descendants to match UI with state.
- Q: In larger apps, is it possible for one stage change to degrade performance while re-rendering all its children components?
- *ONLY IF you do notice performance issues*, then perhaps using `React.memo()` will help
   - it's a utility that memoizes a component and prevents it from re-rendering if its props/state haven't changed
- Replace our `<H2 />` component with our memoized `<H2_v2 />` Does emoji still re-render?
```jsx
import { memo } from "react";
   ...
const H2_v2 = memo(H2);
   ...
<H2_v2 />
```

# Optimization: useMemo

- Allows us to memoize/remember a computed value between renders which

```jsx
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(1);
  const [renderCount, setRenderCount] = useState(0);

  const factorial = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Calculating factorial')
    const calculate = (n) => {
      if (n <= 0) return 1;
      return n * calculate(n - 1);
    };
    return calculate(number);
  }, [number]);

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="number"
        value={number}
        onChange={(e) => setNumber(parseInt(e.target.value))}
      />
      <p>Factorial of {number} is {factorial}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>Re-render</button>
      <p>Render count: {renderCount}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Exercise: useMemo on a filtered list
Refactor Lesson12 (fetching recipes) to include an input box from which to filter fetched recipes

```jsx
  const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
  ... 
  const filteredRecipes = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("filtering Recipes");
    if (!searchQuery) return recipes;
    return recipes.filter((recipe) =>
      recipe.strMeal.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
    );
  }, [searchQuery, recipes]);
  ...
      <hr />
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Search"
        onChange={(e) => setSearchQuery(e.target.value)}
      />
      <hr />

      <ul className={styled.recipes}>
        {filteredRecipes.length > 0 &&
          filteredRecipes.map((recipe) => <li>{recipe.strMeal}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
};
```

<!--
- try changing categories state by using React devtools and deleting categories to test if console logs out "filtering recipes"

# Optimization: useCallback

```jsx
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [count2, setCount2] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  }, []);

  const prevIncRef = useRef(increment);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Fn changed: ", prevIncRef.current !== increment);
    prevIncRef.current = increment;
  }, [increment]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount2(count2 + 1)}>
        Change different state to trigger re-render
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

# Homework

- Refactor the weather app we did for our first exercise (see https://codepen.io/codevilla/pen/YPyWWpm) into the following components.  Then separate the css into its respective components that you created.
Feel free to create more components inside `<Forecast>` as you see fit.  FYI - ignore my `this.whatever` or `this.state.whatever` code below since I was using class-based React which you won't be using.
  ```jsx
  return (
      <div>
        <header>
          <Nav city={this.state.currentCity} handleCityChange={this.changeCity} />
        </header>
        <main>
          <TodayWeather
            city={this.state.currentCity}
            handleCoordsChange={this.changeCoords}
          />
          <Forecast lat={this.state.lat} lon={this.state.lon} />
        </main>
      </div>
    );
  ```
